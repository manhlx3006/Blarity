# Blarity
Blarity is a platform which is built on Ethereum where charitable organizations or individuals can raise fund with cryptocurrencies, and people can donate money with whatever token they have.

Each project is managed by a Ethereum Smart Contract, guarantees the transparency of donated money (balances, transactions, ...) and more importantly, donors can control the money by voting.

Donors can vote or delegate their votes to a trusted DAO (Delegator). Every activity that requires funds from smart contract will need to have approved from Delegators via voting.

This project won the first prize (**100,000,000 VND**) at State of Chain 2018 (https://stateofchain.io/) over more than 25 teams from many countries, companies, ...
